## Current State
This project is lead and develop by the TecIntel Club (a.k.a. Computer Club) in Greensboro Day School, North Carolina.

We are currently designing the user interface and project structure.

Because most club members are new to programming, we do suggest everybody to focus on the front designing using HTML
and CSS.

## Contributions
For non-club members if you got any ideas or suggestions, feel free to contact any club members under the `Developers`
section, or you can create Pull Requests if can't find us.

For club members, do not push the code directly into the `master` branch, please create a Pull Request to submit your
code.

Check the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.MD) before submitting your code.

## Deployment
The project will be deployed under the [dayschool.club](https://dayschool.club) domain and hosted on a non GDS virtual
server.
